# cave-kitty pack reference

> **Generated page — do not edit by hand.** This file is produced by `scripts/docs/gen_pack_reference.py` from the pack source. Hand edits are overwritten on regeneration, and the CI drift gate fails on any difference.

## Provenance & integrity

- **Pack directory:** `packs/cave-kitty`
- **Declared version:** `1.0.0`
- **Content checksum (sha256):** `1d525053d220bf3f32fdeccc15ec1e1821596dd63cb67ab830daab7f118e9b18`
- **Checksum recipe:** sha256 over the sorted `(relative-path + NUL + bytes + LF)` of every file in the pack directory. Re-hash a downloaded pack with the same recipe to verify integrity.

## Purpose

An open Spec Kitty Charter Pack that makes an agent answer in a compressed, token-saving
"caveman" voice — outcome-first, filler cut — while keeping every payload and every negation
exact and restoring full sentences at a cliff edge.

The styleguide and directive are the clean instrument for that purpose. The pack's `cave-dev`
mission type re-states the built-in `software-dev` step contract as prose and overrides only the
agent's output prose, compressing it to the caveman voice; the engineering rigour stays
`software-dev`'s. See the pack's `README.md` for the scope notes and runtime caveats.

**Depends on:** `01ARWG13C000000000000000FG >=1.0,<2`
